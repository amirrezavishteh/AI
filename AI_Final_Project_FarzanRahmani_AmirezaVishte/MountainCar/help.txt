is stochastic in terms of their initial state, within a given range

regarding both mountain car environments, the cars are underpowered to climb the mountain,
so it takes some effort to reach the top.

Given an action, the mountain car follows the following transition dynamics:
velocityt+1 = velocityt + (action - 1) * force - cos(3 * positiont) * gravity
positiont+1 = positiont + velocityt+1
where force = 0.001 and gravity = 0.0025. The collisions at either end are inelastic with 
the velocity set to 0 upon collision with the wall. The position is clipped to the range 
[-1.2, 0.6] and velocity is clipped to the range [-0.07, 0.07].

Reward
The goal is to reach the flag placed on top of the right hill as quickly as possible, as
 such the agent is penalised with a reward of -1 for each timestep.

S0
The position of the car is assigned a uniform random value in [-0.6 , -0.4].
 The starting velocity of the car is always assigned to 0
